        <h2>Revolutionizing Healing in Africa</h2>
        <p>
            ArtNovaX is more than a foundation — it's a movement. A first-of-its-kind in Africa, we fuse art, research,
            and technology to unlock new frontiers in youth mental health.

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
            ArtNovaX Mental Health Foundation was born from the belief that Africa deserves bold, localized, and
            innovative approaches to mental health. We are youth-led, female-founded, and rooted in lived experience. We
            use art therapy not as a side tool, but as a central force in healing. Our mission? To make mental wellbeing
            accessible, expressive, and driven by technology. From hosting painting sessions to building digital
            solutions, we aim to make a lasting impact in schools, communities, and clinical spaces across the
            continent.

            ArtNovaX is redefining what healing looks like in Africa. We're not just raising awareness — we're building
            a system. We combine ancient forms of expression with cutting-edge digital tools to make therapy accessible,
            engaging, and effective. Our foundation is led by young people with lived experience, powered by a belief in
            community, and driven by a bold commitment to innovation. Here, art is science, tech is therapy, and healing
            is a collective revolution.
